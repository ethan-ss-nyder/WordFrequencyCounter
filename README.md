# WordFrequencyCounter
Given a text file, this Python script prints a CSV file of words and their frequency in order of most to least common. Developed as a tool for cluster criticism.

To use this script:
  1. Create a text file in the same folder/directory as this script. Paste all text to be analyzed in this text file. Whitespace does not matter.
  2. Edit the variables at the top of this script. 'filename' should match the name of the text file you've just created. 'exclude_words' can be added to if you're finding the output CSV file hard to analyze because of filler words.
